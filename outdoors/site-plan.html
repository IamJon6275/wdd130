      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever been to a mall? Where everything you could possibly need could be found? An online store is like a mall only it’s space is not limited to the land it’s built on. Amazon may be the most well-known example, but there are online stores for almost every big business out there like Walmart or Home Depot. The people who need online shopping the most though, are those preparing for a trip. Campers, backpackers and other outdoor types. They need a place where they can go to for quality products that can be delivered to them, without the hassle of going to a general store and finding that the thing they need is out of stock, setting their timetable back weeks, months or even years. They need to know exactly when they’re getting something, and I want to give it to them.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The intended audience of this website are those who need both equipment and advice on their outdoor adventure through the wild areas of the world. These are not the hardcore survivalists as they would not require the services of this website, they are likely to know a lot more than me about the outdoors and probably don’t even use guides. This website is for those that are almost completely green in terms of experience and borderline clueless about how to actually get along in the wild.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Color Palette

      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
