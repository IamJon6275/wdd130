      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever been to a mall? Where everything you could possibly need could be found? An online store is like a mall only it’s space is not limited to the land it’s built on. Amazon may be the most well-known example, but there are online stores for almost every big business out there like Walmart or Home Depot. The people who need online shopping the most though, are those preparing for a trip. Campers, backpackers and other outdoor types. They need a place where they can go to for quality products that can be delivered to them, without the hassle of going to a general store and finding that the thing they need is out of stock, setting their timetable back weeks, months or even years. They need to know exactly when they’re getting something, and I want to give it to them.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The intended audience of this website are those who need both equipment and advice on their outdoor adventure through the wild areas of the world. These are not the hardcore survivalists as they would not require the services of this website, they are likely to know a lot more than me about the outdoors and probably don’t even use guides. This website is for those that are almost completely green in terms of experience and borderline clueless about how to actually get along in the wild.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        <h3>Environments</h3>
        <p>
          Foreword: There are many different environments on this planet, each one with its own wonder and its own peril. Where you will be going is what is going to govern what you need to take with you and how you handle yourself. Whether it’s the top of Mount Everest or the middle of the Arabian peninsula. You need to make sure that you have an accurate knowledge of what you will be dealing with on your adventures. This world is not kind to the foolish, you will need to keep your wits about you to avoid dangers from both deadly creatures and the elements if you intend to come back in one piece.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rivers: Rivers are quite an easy trip depending on where you are if you don’t mind portaging your things every couple of miles. This is a varied environment because it could be located in any longitude, rivers can be found in the heart of South America and the Northernmost reaches of Alaska. Rivers can carry many hidden dangers however, to waterborne parasites to dangerous animals that are looking for a drink or even lurking just underneath the surface.
        </p>  
        <p>
          Mountains: Possibly the most difficult environment if just due to the altitude and temperature dangers. Mountains are fairly uniform in terms of temperature and wildlife. Mountains tend to be very cold in the day and even colder at night and very dry regardless of where they are found in the world. Be warned, you could be climbing for most of the trip, if not all of it so proceed with caution when attempting to adventure in this environment. You will not need to worry about fauna as much in the mountains, but there are dangerous animals that like to make this are their home like big cats, wolves and bears.

      <h3>Gear and Equipment</h3>
      <p>
        Foreword: A big part of survival is having the right tool for the right job. Life or death while stranded could hinge on if you brought a flare gun along on your trip. It is particularly important to pack appropriately if you want to make it back home safely and swiftly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bags: Bags are essential to your outdoor experience; it will be the thing that is carrying all of your gear and it will also be protecting it from the elements. There is nothing worse than putting on semi-wet undergarments because your cheap, Walmart-bought rope bag got soaked in the rain because you didn’t want to buy a hiking backpack. A large bag is not always necessary, it depends on the length of your trip and how much gear and food you need to bring with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tents: Much like how a backpack will be keeping your gear safe from both the sun and rain, your tent will be doing that for you as you turn in for the night. A tent is a must when adventuring outdoors anywhere that there are mosquitos and biting flies, the last thing you want is a night out in a marsh without something keeping the bugs from literally eating you alive.
