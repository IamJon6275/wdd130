                A big part of survival is having the right tool 
                for the right job. Life or death while stranded 
                could hinge on if you brought a flare gun along on 
                your trip. It is particularly important to pack 
                appropriately if you want to make it back home 
                safely and swiftly.

                <p>
                    Bags are essential to your outdoor experience; 
                    it will be the thing that is carrying all of 
                    your gear and it will also be protecting it 
                    from the elements. There is nothing worse than 
                    putting on semi-wet undergarments because your 
                    cheap, Walmart-bought rope bag got soaked in 
                    the rain because you did not want to buy a 
                    hiking backpack. A large bag is not always 
                    necessary, it depends on the length of your 
                    trip and how much gear and food you need to 
                    bring with you.

                    Much like how a backpack will be keeping your 
                    gear safe from the elements, your tent will be 
                    doing that for you as you turn in for the 
                    night. A tent is a must when adventuring 
                    outdoors anywhere that there are mosquitos and 
                    biting flies, the last thing you want is a 
                    night out in a marsh without something keeping 
                    the bugs from literally eating you alive.
