                    There are many different environments on this 
                    planet, each one with its own wonder and its own 
                    peril. Where you will be going is what is going to 
                    govern what you need to take with you and how you 
                    handle yourself. Whether it is the top of Mount 
                    Everest or the middle of the Arabian peninsula. 
                    You need to make sure that you have an accurate 
                    knowledge of what you will be dealing with on your 
                    adventures. This world is not kind to the foolish, 
                    you will need to keep your wits about you to avoid 
                    dangers from both deadly creatures and the 
                    elements if you intend to come back in one piece.

                    <h4>
                        Mountains
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Possibly the most difficult environment if 
                        just due to the altitude and temperature 
                        dangers. Mountains are fairly uniform in 
                        terms of temperature and wildlife. 
                        Mountains tend to be very cold in the day 
                        and even colder at night and very dry 
                        regardless of where they are found in the 
                        world. Be warned, you could be climbing 
                        for most of the trip, if not all of it so 
                        proceed with caution when attempting to 
                        adventure in this environment. You will 
                        not need to worry about fauna as much in 
                        the mountains, but there are dangerous 
                        animals that like to make this are their 
                        home like big cats, wolves and bears.

                    <p>
                        Rivers are quite an easy trip depending on 
                        where you are if you do not mind portaging 
                        your things every couple of miles. This is 
                        a varied environment because it could be 
                        located in any longitude, rivers can be 
                        found in the heart of South America and 
                        the Northernmost reaches of Alaska. Rivers 
                        can carry many hidden dangers however, to 
                        waterborne parasites to dangerous animals 
                        that are looking for a drink or even 
                        lurking just underneath the surface.
