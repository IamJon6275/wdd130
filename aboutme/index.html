        Hello everyone. I am 24 years old and I am a software engineering major, I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree.
        I enjoy games, either digital or table-top. I particularly enjoy the video game Deep Rock Galactic
        and the board game Dungeons and Dragons.
    <p>
        I have been a member of the church all my life. I just got back from serving a service mission in Colorado.
        A service mission consists of serving at various charity organizations and being called to serve in advanced church callings.
        What I personally did was serve at the Goodwill offices, the Habitat for Humanity ReStore and at the Denver temple as an ordinance worker.
    </p>    
        I lived in England for around two years and attended their
        equivalent of junior high school there, that's where I got the
        nicknames J-Dawg, I'm still unclear why. I have been all over the British Isles,
        I have been to Europe and I have seen Rome, London and Paris.
        I personally didn't think it was anything special though, the very least it did was make me
        appreciate the United States just that much more.
